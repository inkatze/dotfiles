# Environment Configuration

This system is configured with the following development environment:

## Shell Environment
- **Shell**: Fish shell (`fish`) - A smart and user-friendly command line shell
- **Version Manager**: `mise` (formerly rtx) - Multi-language runtime version manager
- **Terminal Multiplexer**: `tmux` - Terminal session manager

## Running Commands

When you need to execute commands on this system, please use this environment setup:

### Fish Shell
The default shell is Fish. Run commands directly in Fish:
```fish
# Fish shell commands work natively
echo "Hello from Fish"
```

### Mise for Runtime Management
Use `mise` to manage language versions (Node.js, Python, Ruby, etc.):
```fish
mise list              # List installed runtimes
mise current           # Show current versions
mise install node@20   # Install specific versions
```

### Tmux Sessions
Tmux is available for managing terminal sessions:
```fish
tmux ls                # List sessions
tmux attach -t session # Attach to session
tmux new -s session    # Create new session
```

## Important Notes
- Fish shell uses different syntax than bash/zsh (e.g., `set` instead of `export` for variables)
- `mise` handles all runtime version management (replaces nvm, rbenv, pyenv, etc.)
- Configuration files are managed through Ansible and symlinked from this dotfiles repository
