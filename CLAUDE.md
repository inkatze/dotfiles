# Dotfiles

Personal dotfiles managed by Ansible. This repo is the source of truth for
`~/.claude/` config, `~/.config/fish/`, tmux, mise, and related surfaces.
Edit files here, then run Ansible to propagate. Never edit materialized files
directly. See `specs/README.md` for planned improvements.

## How Claude config is materialized

Tracked Claude sources live under the Ansible role, not where they appear at
runtime:

| Runtime path | Tracked source | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` | `roles/osx/files/CLAUDE.md` | Symlink (outside `claude/` subdirectory) |
| `~/.claude/commands/*` | `roles/osx/files/claude/commands/` | Symlink |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | `roles/osx/files/claude/settings.json` | jq merge (not symlink) |

Always edit the tracked source. The materialized file in `~/.claude/` is
overwritten on the next Ansible run. Run `readlink` on any `~/.claude/` file
before editing to confirm whether it is symlinked.

## Permissions three-layer model

| Layer | File | Scope | Persistence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Global tracked | `~/.claude/settings.json` (via this repo) | Cross-project allows + deny list | Durable, committed |
| Per-repo tracked | `<repo>/.claude/settings.json` | Project-specific durable allows | Durable, committed |
| Per-repo local | `<repo>/.claude/settings.local.json` | Ephemeral, short rules | Nukeable, gitignored |

For this dotfiles repo, the tracked `.claude/settings.json` holds
dotfiles-specific durable rules. Keep `.claude/settings.local.json`
near-empty.

## Adding a new Claude command

1. Drop the file under `roles/osx/files/claude/commands/`.
2. Include command front-matter (required for discovery).
3. Commit and run Ansible (or wait for the next symlink task run).
4. Verify in a fresh Claude session.

Skills and hooks are not managed by Ansible yet. Adding them requires a new
tracked directory plus a matching symlink task in `roles/osx/tasks/osx.yml`.

## Do not edit directly in `~/.claude/`

Any file symlinked from this repo is overwritten on the next Ansible run.
Always `readlink` first. Edit the tracked source instead.

## Ansible role layout

`roles/osx/` is the Mac role. Claude-related files live under
`roles/osx/files/claude/`; symlink tasks are in `roles/osx/tasks/`.
